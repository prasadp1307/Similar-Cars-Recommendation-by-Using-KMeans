# Similar-Cars-Recommendation-by-Using-KMeans

Author : Prasad Patharvat

Kmeans algorithm is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into Kpre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group.

To achieve this objective, K-means looks for a fixed number (k) of clusters in a dataset.‚Äù A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities. You'll define a target number k, which refers to the number of centroids you need in the dataset.

Elbow Curve :

The elbow method runs k-means clustering on the dataset for a range of values for k (say from 1-10) and then for each value of k computes an average score for all clusters. By default, the distortion score is computed, the sum of square distances from each point to its assigned cente
